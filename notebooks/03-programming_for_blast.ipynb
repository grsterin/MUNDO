    "\n",
    "This notebook presents examples of methods for using `BLAST` programmatically, with a local installation of `BLAST`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be very convenient to use a web BLAST in the browser - such as the [NCBI interface](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi), or a project-specific instance (like this one at the [PGSC](http://solanaceae.plantbiology.msu.edu/blast.shtml)) - for `BLAST` searches, but there can be limitations to this approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may not be practical to submit a large number of simultaneous queries via a web form, either because the interface prevents this, or because it is tiresome to point-and-click over and over again. It may be that the interface does not make it easy to change custom options that you might want to modify to help refine your query. It could be the case that the web database does not contain sequences that you are interested in searching against (if, for example, some of the sequences are proprietary), or it might not be constrained to a relevant set of organisms, so the search might take much longer than it needs to for your purposes. If you need to repeat a query, it can be awkward to get the same settings every time, and it is possible to forget options from search to search; also the returned result may not describe how or when the search was run.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p></p>\n",
    "<div class=\"alert-success\">\n",
    "<b>Using a programmatic approach to submitting `BLAST` queries provides a number of potential advantages</b>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is easy to set up repeatable searches for many sequences, or collections of sequences\n",
    "* It is easy to read in the search results and conduct downstream analyses that add value to your search\n",
    "* The same code can be readily adapted to different BLAST instances, databases, and servers\n",
    "\n",
    "The code that we develop in this notebook will be adapted for use in the next notebook: `04-programming_web_blast`, but we focus on a local installation now to understand the main principles."
